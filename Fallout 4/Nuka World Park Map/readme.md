## About this image

I wasn't sure where to post this so I'm putting it here.

I wanted to make something with the Nuka-World park maps that you can find in the dlc and moreover, I wanted to make something functional.
So I thought: let's mark the important locations on the thing so that it could work as an alternative to the Pip-Boy map.
But I also wanted it to look like something that would be made in-universe so I spent almost an entire day making this just the way I wanted it to be.

So how did I do this?

Well first I extracted the map and also the background of those notes you can find using the Bethesda Archive Extractor tool.
From there it was just checking the wiki and the game and actually draw it in paint.net.
The main font is Ink free and Mistral for the area names. (once in black with an overlay in red)
I drew all of it myself with varying success.

Then I printed it only to realize that half of the text wasn't properly readable so I spent another hour or so going over all of the words and lines with actual pens but I'm quite happy with the result.
I thought about dipping it in water as well but I wasn't confident the drawings would survive the process.

If you want to make this for yourself I have a .zip file with the original .pdn files if you want to change anything and also a word document for easy printing.

After printing I'd recommend folding on the lines that are there and to rumple the paper a little to give that wasteland look.
Because there are three pieces you'll have to tape them together.

Anyways, I hope at least a few people like what I made and maybe until next time!
