## Description

### Update v3.0: Now ESP-less

The script has been reworked and is now ESP-less. The basic functionality remains the same as in v2.0 but with the added option to automatically remove (GRA) tags. This makes it possible to change the prefix of those challenges without getting double tags.

### Overview

Do you ever find yourself trying to craft something and forgetting the recipe? Have you ever wondered if it was Scrap Metal or Scrap Electronics that you were missing for that one recipe?

Well, wonder no longer! Inspired by Fallout 4's "Tag For Search" feature, this mod lets you tag recipe ingredients or individual items so you can find them easier in the world or in your storage containers.

Unlike Fallout 4's implementation, this mod will tag all ingredients instead of just the ones that you're missing. You can also tag and untag individual items in your inventory or in container menus.

Press 'T' to tag or untag recipes and items. This will simply add a '*' to the name and save the EditorId to an INI file. This list will also be applied on startup so your tags are saved but save file stays clean.

I suppose you could also use this to pin Med-X to the top of the AID category or something.

#### Config

The config file will be automatically generated at *"Data/Config/StarlightSkull/TagForSearch.ini"* the first time this mod is loaded. Here you can change the hotkey to something else if you want, see [this list](https://geckwiki.com/index.php?title=DirectX_Scancodes) for the IDs per key.

If needed, you can manually change the list too. Entries from uninstalled plugins will be considered invalid and will be ignored.
