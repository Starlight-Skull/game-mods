Basic support for Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered

This is a very basic Vortex extension that adds support for Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered.

This is essentially the same as my TR I-III Remastered Vortex Plugin.

This plugin will simply install any installed mods in the root directory of the game so make sure the directory matches the one of the game.

Both Steam and GOG should work out of the box but I don't currently own the game so I can't verify.
