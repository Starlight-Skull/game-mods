Inspired by the Dungeon Defenders 2 crossover.

In Dungeon Defenders 2's part of the crossover the dryad is a playable character and is able to change into a corrupt form.

I used the model of that game as a reference but I also took some liberties to keep the sprite from looking completely purple.

Give it a try and let me know what you think.

I don't know what else to tell you.
